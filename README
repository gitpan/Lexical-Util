NAME

    Lexical::Util - utilities for lexical item manipulation

VERSION

    0.7

SYNOPSIS

    use Lexical::Util qw(frame_to_cvref lexalias ref_to_lexical);

    $cvref = frame_to_cvref($level);
    lexalias($cvref, '$name', \$variable);
    $ref = ref_to_lexical($cvref, '$name');

DESCRIPTION

    Lexical::Util is a module containing some common routines used by
    modules dealing with the lexical variables of routines other than
    their own. They are taken from various sources, including PadWalker,
    Perl6::Binding, and Lexical::Alias. This module is used in version
    0.7 and greater of Perl6::Binding, as well as in the
    Object::Variables and Sub::Declaration packages, to prevent
    duplication of code.

    This package should not be needed or used by end users.

    Note: this module uses the CvPADLIST and CvDEPTH macros, which are
    listed in perlintern and not part of the perl API. They work in the
    versions I've been able to test on (5.6.1 and 5.8.4), but may change
    in the future. To avoid possible problems, this module tests to see
    that the Perl version is less than 5.9.0.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install
